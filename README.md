eLBeeMKLocalSearch
==================

Just an example of how to use MKLocalSearch within a MKMapView.  This is an updated version based on the [original code](http://phpadvocate.com/blog/2013/01/ios-6-1-simple-example-using-mklocalsearch/) posted on [my blog](http://www.phpadvocate.com) earlier this year.

Hope this helps :neckbeard:
